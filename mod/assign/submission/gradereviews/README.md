# moodle-assignsubmission_gradereviews

This plugin is a copy of the core submission comment plugin excepts than you have permissions that allow to restrict people who can:
* create and see the comments
* delete the comments

Common use case of this plugin: grade reviewers enter comments about the submission (content, grade...) for teachers to be aware of potential problems. 
For example the grade reviewer may have detected plagiarism or think that the grade is not optimal. 
The students should not be allowed to see these comments.

## Install
* add the content in the foler: mod/assign/submission/gradereviews
* optional: in the Moodle admin tweak the permissions. The permission are listed in db/access.php.
