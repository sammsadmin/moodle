# Bulk Email admin tool for Moodle 3.9+

This is an admin tool plugin for Moodle 3.9+ which adds an action to bulk user actions allowing you to send emails to a list of users.

The plugin adds a new "bulkemail:sendbulkemails" capability to the system, mapped to the manager role and site admins by default, which determines if a user can send emails using the feature.

To install, either add the bulkemail folder to the /admin/tool folder of your Moodle installation and navigate to /admin to detect and install, or zip the plugin and use it with Moodle's plugin upload feature.
